## Version 1.6.0

### New

- Added patch functions that take in shaders as strings directly. 
  - These functions do not load shaders from file.

### NOTE

- **Loader functions will be depricated in a future release**. Instead getting their own package.
  - These include:
    - `loadShaders`
    - `loadShadersRaw`
    - `loadShadersCSM`
  - This is to remove [`CSM`](https://github.com/FarazzShaikh/THREE-CustomShaderMaterial)'s dependance on `gl-noise` to easy load shaders.
